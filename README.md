# FileManager
A programm that can can perform a variety of actions (some at the same time) on Folders & Files.

## Some actions:
* Edit MP3-MetaData
* Backup
* Copy/Move all files recursively
* Rename many files at once with rules


## Build-Note
* Import ***OLDER 1.0.0*** build of [Java-Project-Library](https://github.com/realPaulsen/Java-Project-Library) into Project before building
* Uses [mp3agic](https://github.com/mpatric/mp3agic)

## TODO
* (Edit-Action) Add length-variable to parser to calculate new file-name (e.g. set endIndex to "l - 3" to indicate the 3rd-last position of the filename to the parser)
* Add [mp3agic](https://github.com/mpatric/mp3agic) as library instead of sourcecode
